# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ GOBL Italy Tax Regime

Italy uses the FatturaPA format for their e-invoicing system.

Example IT GOBL files can be found in the [`examples`](./examples) (YAML uncalculated documents) and [`examples/out`](./examples/out) (JSON calculated envelopes) subdirectories.

## Public Documentation

### FatturaPA

- [FatturaPA documentation: Agenzia delle Entrate's webside](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/web/guest/fatturazione-elettronica-e-dati-fatture-transfrontaliere-new)
- [FatturaPA documentation: FatturPA's website](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/norme-e-regole/documentazione-fattura-elettronica/formato-fatturapa/)

#### Ordinary invoices (Fattura Ordinaria)
- [Schema V1.2.3 PDF (IT)](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/documenti/fatturapa/v1.2.2/RappresentazioneTabellareFattOrdinariav123.pdf) - most up-to-date but in Italian.
- [Schema V1.2.1 Spec Table View (EN)](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/documenti/fatturapa/v1.2.1/Table-view-B2B-Ordinary-invoice.pdf) - last version of the table translated to English. Since the difference between 1.2.3 and 1.2.1 is minimal, this is perfectly usable.
- [XSD V1.2.2](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/export/documenti/fatturapa/v1.2.2/Schema_del_file_xml_FatturaPA_v1.2.2.xsd)

##### Changes from 1.2.1 to 1.2.3
- Documentation changes: TD25, N1, N6.2, N7
- Addition of TD28: Acquisti da San Marino con IVA (fattura cartacea)
- New codes have been introduced for the AltriDatiGestionali block for agricultural producers under the special regime.
- New check has been introduced to reject invoices with invalidated declaration of intent 00477.
-The guidelines for the use of TD28 for transactions to and from entities not established in Italy have been updated.

## Italy specifics

Italy requires all invoices to comply with the [FatturaPA](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/index.html) format which includes support for a specific set of fields unique to Italy. GOBL tries to guess what the best options are so that the conversion process is simple, but some data needs to be added manually.

Unfortunately, the FatturaPA format adds considerable complexity as it was designed for two purposes in one format:

- Regular invoices sent to customers, and,
- Invoices received from suppliers that are not part of the Italian system, these are described as "self-billed" invoices.

A better way to consider electronic invoices in Italy is perhaps to think of them as micro-tax-declarations as opposed to just a format designed to ease the communication with customers.

We've tried to describe how to deal with many of the exception cases and special usages in this page, but if you find something that is not supported, please get in touch.

### Reverse Charge Mechanism

The regular approach in GOBL to indicate that an invoice is subject to the "reverse charge" mechanism, is simply to include the `reverse-charge` tag inside the invoice's tax section.

Unfortunately in Italy this alone is not sufficient, each line item inside the document needs to be attributed with a specific exemption code. These are defined in the "Nature" (Natura) section below. Take the following line for example:

```json
{
  "quantity": "20",
  "item": {
    "name": "Development services",
    "price": "90.00"
  },
  "taxes": [
    {
      "cat": "VAT",
      "rate": "exempt",
      "ext": {
        "it-sdi-nature": "N6.9"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

When converting to FatturaPA the "Nature" code will be set to `N6.9`.

### Stamp Duty

Stamp Duty ("Imposta di bollo") is a fixed priced tax applied to the production, request, or presentation of certain documents: civil, commercial, judicial and extrajudicial documents, on notices, or posters.

These can be added to GOBL Invoices as "charges" (`bill.Charge`) defined with the `stamp-duty` (`it.ChargeKeyStampDuty`) key, for example:

```json
{
  "charges": [
    {
      "key": "stamp-duty",
      "amount": "2.00",
      "reason": "Imposta di bollo"
    }
  ]
}
```

See also [examples/stamp-duty.json](./examples/stamp-duty.json).

### Numero REA

If you need to include an REA number ("Repertorio delle notizie Economiche e Amministrative") in your invoices, you can use the `registration` ([org.Registration](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/registration) property of a [org.Part](https://docs.gobl.org/draft-0/org/party) object.

The fields used are:

- `capital` - share capital
- `currency` - currency of the share capital, usually `EUR`
- `office` - province code for the company
- `entry` - registration number itself

For example:

```json
{
  "registration": {
    "capital": "50000.00",
    "currency": "EUR",
    "office": "RM",
    "entry": "123456"
  }
}
```

### Tax System - "Regime Fiscale"

The tax system ("Regime Fiscale") needs to be defined to suppliers in all Italian FatturaPA invoices. The default code `RF01` will always be used unless overridden in an extension field with the `it-sdi-fiscal-regime` tag.

The following identities are defined:

| Code   | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |

```js
{
  "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice",
  // [...]
  "supplier": {
    "name": "MÂªF. Services",
    "tax_id": {
      "country": "IT",
      "code": "12345678903"
    },
    "ext": {
      "it-sdi-fiscal-regime": "RF02"
    }
  }
  // [...]
}
```

### Payment Means (ModalitaPagamento)

The FatturaPA format defines its own set of payment means to declare invoices with the SDI. Take the following example of the payment property inside an invoice:

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instructions": {
      "key": "credit-transfer",
      "bank": {
        "iban": "IT60X0542811101000000123456",
        "bic": "ABCDITMM"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The following table describes how to map the Italian payment means codes to those of GOBL. The list is somewhat based on the official mapping of the FatturaPA codes to EU Semantic invoice definition, more details available [here](https://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/portale/documents/20143/288396/Technical+Rules+for+European+Invoicing+v2.1.pdf).

### Document Type (TipoDocumento)

All Italian invoices must be identified with a specific type code defined by the FatturaPA format. The following table helps identify how GOBL will map the expected Italian code with a combination of the Invoice Type and tax tags.

| Code | Type          | Tax Tags                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
