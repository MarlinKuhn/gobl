# üá¨üá∑ GOBL Greece Tax Regime

Greece uses the myDATA and Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 formats for their e-invoicing/tax-reporting system.

Example GR GOBL files can be found in the [`examples`](./examples) (YAML uncalculated documents) and [`examples/out`](./examples/out) (JSON calculated envelopes) subdirectories.

## Greece specifics

### Invoice Type

The Greek tax authority (IAPR) requires the invoice type to be specified as part of the invoice. In GOBL, this type can be set using the `gr-mydata-invoice-type` extension in the tax section.

Alternatively, GOBL will set the extension for you based on the type and the tax tags you set in your GOBL invoice. The table below shows how this mapping is done:

| Type   | Description                                     | GOBL Type     | GOBL Tags                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |----------------------------|
| `1.1`  | Sales Invoice                                   | `standard`    | `goods`                    |
| `1.2`  | Sales Invoice/Intra-community Supplies          | `standard`    | `goods`, `export`, `eu`    |
| `1.3`  | Sales Invoice/Third Country Supplies            | `standard`    | `goods`, `export`          |
| `1.4`  | Sales Invoice/Sale on Behalf of Third Parties   | `standard`    | `goods`, `self-billed`     |
| `2.1`  | Service Rendered Invoice                        | `standard`    | `services`                 |
| `2.2`  | Intra-community Service Rendered Invoice        | `standard`    | `services`, `export`, `eu` |
| `2.3`  | Third Country Service Rendered Invoice          | `standard`    | `services`, `export`       |
| `5.1`  | Credit Invoice/Associated                       | `credit-note` |                            |
| `11.1` | Retail Sales Receipt                            | `standard`    | `goods`, `simplified`      |
| `11.2` | Service Rendered Receipt                        | `standard`    | `services`, `simplified`   |
| `11.3` | Simplified Invoice                              | `standard`    | `simplified`               |
| `11.4` | Retail Sales Credit Note                        | `credit-note` | `simplified`               |
| `11.5` | Retail Sales Receipt on Behalf of Third Parties | `credit-note` | `goods`, `simplified`, `self-billed` |

For example, this is how you set the IAPR invoice type explicitly:

```js
{
  "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice",
  // ...
  "tax": {
    "ext": {
      "gr-mydata-invoice-type": "2.1"
    }
  }
}
```

And this is how you'll get the same result by using the GOBL type and tags:

```js
{
  "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice",
  // ...
  "type": "standard",
  "tax": {
    "tags": ["services"]
  }
}
```

### VAT categories

Greece has three VAT rates: standard, reduced and super-reduced. Each of these rates are reduced by a 30% on the islands of Leros, Lesbos, Kos, Samos and Chios. The tax authority identifies each rate with a specific VAT category.

In GOBL, the IAPR VAT category code must be set using the `gr-mydata-vat-rate` extension of a line's tax to one of the codes:

| Code | Description                 | GOBL Rate              |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `1`  | Standard rate               | `standard`             |
| `2`  | Reduced rate                | `reduced`              |
| `3`  | Super-reduced rate          | `super-reduced`        |
| `4`  | Standard rate (Island)      | `standard+island`      |
| `5`  | Reduced rate (Island)       | `reduced+island`       |
| `6`  | Super-reduced rate (Island) | `super-reduced+island` |
| `7`  | Without VAT                 | `exempt`               |
| `8`  | Records without VAT         |                        |


Please, note that GOBL will automatically set the proper `gr-mydata-vat-rate` code and tax percent automatically when the line tax uses any of the GOBL rates specified in the table above. For example:

```js
{
  "$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice",
  // ...
  "lines": [
    {
      "i": 1,
      "quantity": "20",
      "item": {
        "name": "Œ•œÄŒ∑œÅŒµœÉŒØŒµœÇ ŒëŒΩŒ¨œÄœÑœÖŒæŒ∑œÇ",
        "price": "90.00",
      },
      "sum": "1800.00",
      "taxes": [
        {
          "cat": "VAT",
          "rate": "standard+island"
        }
      ],
      "total": "1800.00"
    }
  ],
}
```

### VAT exemptions

Greece invoices can be exempt of VAT for different causes and the tax authority require a specific cause code to be provided.

In a GOBL invoice, the `rate` of a line's tax need to be set to `exempt`, and the `ext` map's `gr-mydata-exemption` property needs to be set to one of these codes:

| Code | Description                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`  | Without VAT - article 3 of the VAT code                 |

| `24` | Without VAT - article 6 of the VAT code                 |
| `25` | Without VAT - Œ†ŒüŒõ.1029/1995                             |

    "item": {
      "name": "Œ•œÄŒ∑œÅŒµœÉŒØŒµœÇ ŒëŒΩŒ¨œÄœÑœÖŒæŒ∑œÇ",
      "price": "90.00",
    },
    "sum": "1800.00",
    "taxes": [
      {
        "cat": "VAT",
        "rate": "exempt",
        "ext": {
          "gr-mydata-exemption": "30"
        }
      }
    ],
    "total": "1800.00"
  }
]
```

### Payment Methods

The IAPR requires invoices to specify a payment method code. In a GOBL invoice, the payment means is set using the `key` field in the payment instructions. The following table lists all the IAPR payment methods and how GOBL will map from the payment instructions key to each of them:

| Code | Name                             | GOBL Payment Instruction Key |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `1`  | Domestic Payments Account Number | `credit-transfer`            |
| `2`  | Foreign Payments Account Number  | `credit-transfer+foreign`    |
| `3`  | Cash                             | `cash`                       |
| `4`  | Check                            | `cheque`                     |
| `5`  | On credit                        | `promissory-note`            |
| `6`  | Web Banking                      | `online`                     |
| `7`  | POS / e-POS                      | `card`                       |

For example:

```js
"payment": {
  "instructions": {
    "key": "credit-transfer+foreign" // Will set the IAPR Payment Method to "2"
  }
}
```

### Income Classification

Invoices reported to the Greek tax authority via myDATA can optionally include information about the income classification of each invoice item.

In a GOBL invoice, the `gr-mydata-income-cat` and `gr-mydata-income-type` extensions can be set at item level to any of the values expected by the IAPR:

#### Income Category
