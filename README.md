## Introduction

GOBL, the Go Business Language library and tools, aim to:

- Help developers build electronic business documents, especially invoices, anywhere in the world.
- Define a a set of open [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/).
- Build a global database of local tax categories and, whenever practical to do so, provide current and historical tax rates in code.
- Validate business documents according to local requirements, including tax ID validation.
- Define the algorithms used to make tax calculations while avoiding rounding errors.
- Provide built-in support for signing documents using [JSON Web Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Signature).
- Output simple and easy to read JSON documents that emphasize the use of keys instead of abstract codes, like `credit-transfer` instead of `30` (UNTDID4461 code for sender initiated bank or wire transfer).
- Be flexible enough to support extreme local complexity but produce output that is easily legible in other countries.
- Build a global community of contributors tired of the complexity of current standards based on XML or EDI.

## Community

The complexity around invoicing and in particular electronic invoicing can quickly become overwhelming. Check out the following resources and get in touch:

- [Documentation](https://docs.gobl.org) contains details on how to use GOBL, and the schema.
- [Builder](https://build.gobl.org) helps try out GOBL and quickly figure out what is possible, all from your browser.
- [Issues](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/issues) if you have a specific problem with GOBL related to code or usage.
- [Discussions](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/discussions) for open discussions about the future of GOBL, complications with a specific country, or any open ended issues.
- [Pull Requests](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/pulls) are very welcome, especially if you'd like to see a new local country or features.
- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/goblschema/shared_invite/zt-20qu1s0cm-AUE8oYbGly681EsYdDiqxw) for real-time chat about something specific or urgent. We always encourage you to use one of the others options which are indexed and searchable, but if you'd like to bring something to attentional quickly, this is a great resource.

## Companion Projects

GOBL makes it easy to create business documents, like invoices, but checkout some of the companion projects that help create, use, and convert into other formats:

- [CLI](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.cli) - the official GOBL command line tool, including WASM release for streaming in browsers.
- [Builder](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.builder) - Available to try at [build.gobl.org](https://build.gobl.org), this tool makes it easy to build, test, and discover the features of GOBL.
- [Generator](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.generator) - Ruby project to convert GOBL JSON Schema into libraries for other languages or documentation.
- [Docs](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.docs) - Content of the official GOBL Documentation Site [docs.gobl.org](https://docs.gobl.org).
- [GOBL for Ruby](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.ruby) - Easily build or read GOBL documents in Ruby.

Conversion to local formats
- [GOBL to FacturaE (Spain)](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.facturae) - convert into the [Spanish FacturaE](https://www.facturae.gob.es/Paginas/Index.aspx) format.
- [GOBL to CFDI (Mexico)](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.cfdi) - convert into the Mexican CFDI format.
- [GOBL to FatturaPA (Italy)](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.fatturapa) - convert into the [Italian FatturaPA](https://www.fatturapa.gov.it/it/index.html) format.
- [GOBL to FA_VAT / KSeF](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.ksef) - convert to the Polish FA_VAT format and send to [KSeF](https://www.podatki.gov.pl/ksef/)
- [GOBL to TicketBAI (Spain/Euskadi)](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.ticketbai) - convert into [TicketBAI](https://www.batuz.eus/fitxategiak/batuz/ticketbai/ticketBaiV1-2.xsd) documents, required in the Euskadi (northern region of Spain)

## Usage

GOBL is a Go library, so the following instructions assume you'd like to build documents from your own Go applications. See some of the links above if you'd like to develop in another language or use a CLI.

### Installation

Run the following command to install the package:

```
go get github.com/invopop/gobl
```

### Building an Invoice

There are lots of different ways to get data into GOBL but for the following example we're going to try and build an invoice in several steps.

First define a minimal or "partial" GOBL Invoice Document:

```go
inv := &bill.Invoice{
	Series:    "F23",
	Code:      "00010",
	IssueDate: cal.MakeDate(2023, time.May, 11),
	Supplier: &org.Party{
		TaxID: &tax.Identity{
			Country: l10n.US,
		},
		Name:  "Provider One Inc.",
		Alias: "Provider One",
		Emails: []*org.Email{
			{
				Address: "billing@provideone.com",
			},
		},
		Addresses: []*org.Address{
			{
				Number:   "16",
				Street:   "Jessie Street",
				Locality: "San Francisco",
				Region:   "CA",
				Code:     "94105",
				Country:  l10n.US,
			},
		},
	},
	Customer: &org.Party{
		Name: "Sample Customer",
		Emails: []*org.Email{
			{
				Address: "email@sample.com",
			},
		},
	},
	Lines: []*bill.Line{
		{
			Quantity: num.MakeAmount(20, 0),
			Item: &org.Item{
				Name:  "A stylish mug",
				Price: num.MakeAmount(2000, 2),
				Unit:  org.UnitHour,
			},
			Taxes: []*tax.Combo{
				{
					Category: common.TaxCategoryST,
					Percent:  num.NewPercentage(85, 3),
				},
			},
		},
	},
}
```

Notice that the are no sums or calculations yet. The next step involves "inserting" the invoice document into an "envelope". In GOBL, we use the concept of an envelope to hold data and provide functionality to guarantee that no modifications have been made to the payload.

Insert our previous Invoice into an envelope as follows:

```go
// Prepare an "Envelope"
env := gobl.NewEnvelope()
if err := env.Insert(inv); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```
